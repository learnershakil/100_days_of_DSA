# 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

Welcome to the "100_days_of_DSA" repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of class code and notes for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repository is a part of the "Novice Lab" initiative, where we embark on a journey to master DSA concepts and techniques over the course of 100 days.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a structured approach to learning DSA in Java. Each day, new class code and accompanying notes are shared to guide you through various DSA topics, including:

- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
